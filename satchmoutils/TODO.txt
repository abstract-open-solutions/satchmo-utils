- Remove/move locales

- Change the way formextensions.py works in all apps (it has been changed)

- Review contactus and the form action registered as view (the whole thing
  should use a form view class and stop being silly)

- Determine what the fuck emptycart is all about and possibly totally rework it
  in a sane way (right now it sucks from the code to the templates)

- Fix extrabillinginfo (formextensions.py) and check each code file and all the
  templates which are wrong

- Payments right now is an app (with a models.py) to hold templates but, does
  it make sense?
